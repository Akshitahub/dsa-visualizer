# DSA Visualizer

A React app I made to actually *see* how sorting algorithms work — colorful bars moving around so it’s not just lines of code.

## What’s inside

- Visuals for Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, and Quick Sort.
- Play, pause, reset, and speed controls (because sometimes you wanna chill or speedrun).
- Randomize array to keep things fresh.
- Simple UI that just lets the animation do its thing.

## How to run it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akshitahub/dsa-visualizer.git
cd dsa-visualizer
npm install
npm start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and watch the magic.

## What I learned

* React hooks like useState and useEffect — they’re lowkey powerful.
* How sorting algorithms actually move step-by-step.
* Managing timers and async stuff without breaking the flow.
* Keeping the UI clean but effective.

## Next up

* Adding more algorithms like Graph stuff and DP.
* Making it look good on phones.
* Adding little tips so it’s easier to follow.
* Dark mode because vibes.
